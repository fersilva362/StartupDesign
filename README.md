# Hi!
In this project I designed a webpage using React library to show a list of product (fetched from an api) and filtered using different criteria such as: category, color, price and/or rating. The searched results are paginated and showed in a grid 2x2 (each page). The filtered have differents logic, for instance: category and rating filters are enabled by clickable elements, color and price are accessed by typing in input elements that allow dinamically filter the products. 
### Bellow I show a screen print of the app:
